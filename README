What is it?
-----------
ucmaze is a suite for embedded systems, intended to provide a very well known
software/firmware base, intensively tested and benchmarked so it can be adapted
to new software pieces, such as new OSs or frameworks. Its main purpose is to
stay simple and allow adding new simple features and check the impact on the
system overall by profiling, debugging, etc.

Latest version
--------------
ucmaze is hosted on Github, more concretely in the address
https://github.com/jmtorrespalma/ucmaze.git

Be aware that development style is the classic master-devel-feat style, so
master is the branch to keep stable changes and tags, while devel is
continuously under heavy development.

Licensing
---------
See the file accompanying this project called COPYING. Basically all the code,
except where stated differently, is released under GPLv3.

Documentation
-------------
There is no better documentation that the code itself. However, some markdown
documentation is expected to be released in the future.

Building
--------
Build system is based on make, gcc, openocd, qemu and gdb. It's very portable,
but expects some tweaking in terms of setting cross compilation toolchains,
flashing tools and debugging.

This project is targeted for GNU/Linux hosts, but it should work smoothly in
another platforms such as Android or Cygwin.

Testing
-------
A testsuite is provided for developers to test new introduced changes and
effects of refactoring. This can be run with "make check". However, it's still
not available.

Contributing
------------
Juan Manuel Torres Palma <j.m.torrespalma@gmail.com> is the main (and only)
maintainer of the project, but open to external contributions coming in form of
patch or pull request.
