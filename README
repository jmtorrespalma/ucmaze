What is it?
-----------
ucmaze is a suite for embedded systems, intended to provide a very well known
software/firmware base, intensively tested and benchmarked so it can be adapted
to new software pieces, such as new OSs or frameworks. Its main purpose is to
stay simple and allow adding new simple features and check the impact on the
system overall by profiling, debugging, etc.

Latest version

ucmaze is hosted on Github, more concretely in the address
https://github.com/jmtorrespalma/ucmaze.git.

Licensing

except where stated differently, is released under GPLv3.

Documentation
-------------
There is no better documentation that the code itself. However, some markdown
documentation is expected to be released in the future.

Building

Build system is based on make and Kconfig.
