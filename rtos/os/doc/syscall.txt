Every access from userspace to the kernel should be done through a syscall, and
only very few functions are exposed to userspace, only those required.

In implementation details, all syscalls are implemented in functions prefixed
by sys_NAME(). The public API are simply wrappers, that set the arguments
correctly and raise a software interrupt.

Syscalls
--------
task_create()
task_exit()
irq_lock()
irq_unlock()
